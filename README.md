# Malatang Optimiser

This Excel-based tool helps users choose optimal Malatang ingredients and portion sizes based on cost, nutrition, or dietary goals.

It's powered by Excel's Solver, so no coding required - just adjust your preferences and hit Solve.

## Background

When you're building your Malatang bowl, it's super easy to overload on heavy ingredients like tofu or enoki mushrooms — and the grams (and price) really add up fast.

I want to create a simple Excel tool to help people optimise ingredient choices and portion sizes based on budget or dietary targets. Limitation is, I didn’t have access to super detailed ingredient data (exact weights, macros, prices, etc), but if you do - oh well, I’ve built the template so you can plug those in.
